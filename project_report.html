<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Project Report</h1>

</div>


<p>This project report will discuss the details behind our project.</p>
<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The motivation behind this project stems from asylum seekers entering
NYC with a lack of resources on how to survive. These individuals, many
of whom arrive after experiencing trauma, uncertainty, and displacement,
often struggle to navigate the complex system of services and resources
available to them. With increasing numbers of asylum seekers arriving in
the city, providing them with a comprehensive, accessible, and
user-friendly tool to help them find essential services is crucial.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related work</h2>
<p>A huge contributing factor we’ve observed in public health is how
health disparities and social determinants shape the narrative behind
many asylum seekers in NYC. There is a significantly high prevalence of
asylum seekers not getting the care they need and that raises concern on
what ways we can minimize this barrier. One of the findings we
discovered is underweight asylum seekers and how that reveals lack of
accessible food banks, services, etc. that can provide nutrition to
struggling asylum seekers. This represents our reasoning on exploring
this issue.</p>
<p>Here are some of the main topics we researched for this project: <a
href="https://citylimits.org/nyc-shelter-count/#:~:text=The%20new%20report%2C%20Local%20Law,city%20standardizes%20their%20reporting%20format.">shelters</a>,

banks</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial questions:</h2>
<p>Initially, the questions we were trying to answer were: (1) How do
the health-related and demographic trends of immigrants compare to
non-immigrants based on ADD HEALTH data? (2) What resources (e.g.,
shelters, medical facilities) are available to asylum seekers in NYC?
(3) Are these resources equitably distributed across the boroughs of
NYC?</p>
<p>As the project progressed, we refined these questions to focus more
on identifying gaps in resource availability and accessibility. Our
questions included: (1) Are the current shelters sufficient to meet the
needs of asylum seekers? (2) Do certain boroughs have fewer medical
facilities relative to the immigrant population density? (3) How do the
observed demographic and health-related trends inform the specific needs
of asylum seekers in NYC?</p>
<p>During our analysis, additional questions emerged: (1) Are there
patterns of resource utilization among asylum seekers that might
highlight barriers (e.g., language, transportation)? (2) How do the
services available in NYC compare to other cities with significant
asylum-seeking populations? (3) What are the policy implications of our
findings for improving resource allocation for asylum seekers?</p>

<div id="regression-analysis-models" class="section level2">
<h2>Regression Analysis Models</h2>
<p>We conducted a regression analysis to assess whether being a
first-generation immigrant was associated with the following health
outcomes: blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), body mass index
(BMI), and mean arterial pressure which were available health measures
in the Add Health data set. We adjusted for the following covariates to
isolate the variable of interest and control for potential confounders:
age (i.e., standardized), race/ethnicity, education, sex, and
income.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Our analysis highlights several key findings regarding health trends
and resources available to asylum seekers in New York City. Our analysis
of the ADD HEALTH dataset revealed interesting health trends among
immigrant populations. We found that first-generation immigrants were
statistically associated with lower systolic blood pressure (2.49 mmHg
decrease, p = 0.0027) and diastolic blood pressure (1.97 mmHg decrease,
p = 0.0026) compared to second- and third-generation individuals, even
after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors. Also,
first-generation immigrants exhibited a 1.20 decrease in BMI (p =
0.0112), aligning with earlier findings that many first-generation
immigrants are classified as underweight.These health trends highlight
the nuanced relationship between immigrant status and health outcomes.
While the lower blood pressure and BMI may initially appear to be
protective factors, they could also reflect underlying vulnerabilities
such as food insecurity, limited access to healthcare, or stressors
related to immigration status. For first-generation immigrants, these
factors might manifest as a mix of both health benefits (due to
lifestyle factors from their country of origin) and risks (due to
systemic barriers in accessing resources in their host country). These
trends underscore the need for culturally competent healthcare services
that can address the unique needs of immigrant populations.</p>
<p>When it comes to healthcare facilities, the distribution across the
five boroughs is very uneven. Boroughs with higher immigrant
populations, like Queens and the Bronx, have noticeably fewer medical
facilities compared to others. For example, Brooklyn has 26 major
healthcare facilities, but Queens, which is home to many immigrant
families, has just 11. This uneven distribution makes healthcare access
a major burden for asylum seekers in those areas. Families needing
medical care in these boroughs might end up having to travel long
distances for facilities with appointment availability or might face
overcrowded emergency rooms or urgent care facilities in the centers
near them. For immigrants already dealing with language barriers and
limited financial resources, these extra obstacles can be overwhelming.
Addressing this gap means not only increasing the number of facilities
but also making sure they are located where they are needed most.</p>
<p>While investigating shelter usage in NYC, we saw that there has been
a dramatic increase in recent years, with the total number of
individuals utilizing shelters rising from 46,521 in 2022 to 90,798 in
2024. A significant proportion of shelter users are families with
children, which contrasts with the smaller amount of single adults using
these services. This tells us that the need for family-specific shelter
resources is growing rapidly. At the same time, it highlights how
overburdened the current shelter system has become. For asylum seekers
who may be new to the city and navigating an unfamiliar system, this
could make finding shelter even more challenging. Addressing these
trends will require more than just expanding capacity. It calls for
targeted solutions that meet the unique needs of families and vulnerable
newcomers.</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues we encountered during this project was the
lack of clear data on other resources available to asylum seekers.
Services like translation assistance or immigrant health centers are
crucial, but finding detailed information about them was surprisingly
difficult to find. This reflects a broader systemic problem in that if
we struggled to locate this data as researchers, imagine how much harder
it must be for someone new to the city and unfamiliar with its systems.
For asylum seekers, who may already be dealing with language barriers
and a lack of documentation, this gap in information can make it nearly
impossible to find the support they need. The lack of transparency and
centralized information is a glaring issue. Addressing it will require
better documentation of available services and a stronger effort to make
this information accessible to those who need it most.</p>
